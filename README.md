### What is dApp 
A decentralized application (dapp) is an application built on a decentralized network that combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface.

### What this app is doing
It is a File sharing app on hopr network.
It is converting files into base64 string and dividing into the chunks of 400bytes and sending all Encoded string of chunks on node.
and to make file accessable to the user, App collects all chunks(messages) from node and merge all chunks into one base64 string.
Then decodes that string and gives a download link to user.

### Because of server limits 
Try it on your local system on web it fetches data from node not as expected.
Working to make this app work on servers
